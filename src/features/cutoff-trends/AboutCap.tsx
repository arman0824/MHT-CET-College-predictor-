    question: 'What is CAP?',
    answer: 'CAP stands for Centralized Admission Process. It is the counselling process used to allot engineering seats based on your eligibility, merit, category, preferences, and the seats available in each round.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How should I use the cutoff shown on this site?',
    answer: 'Treat a cutoff as a reference point, not a guarantee. Compare your percentile with the cutoff for your exact category, university area, branch, and college before adding an option to your preference form.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What do GOPENH and GOPENO mean?',
    answer: 'GOPENH is the General Open Home University category, while GOPENO is General Open Other than Home University. Always check the category code published for the specific seat type you are eligible for.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why might a college or branch not appear in my results?',
    answer: 'The explorer and predictor show only branches with a published cutoff for your selected category. Change the category, branch, or region filters to review other available options.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I do before submitting my option form?',
    answer: 'Verify your eligibility, documents, category, and the current official CAP information. Keep ambitious, target, and safer preferences in your list, then confirm every choice on the official CET Cell portal.',
